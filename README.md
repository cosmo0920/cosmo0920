### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an open source developer/maintainer and a little mozillian.

I'm currently interested in logging, container environments, monitoring metrics with InfluxDB/Prometheus(, and modern browsers).

  * I'm currently working for logging ecosystem which creates Fluent Bit/Fluentd, monitoring Fluent ecosystem, and also kubernetes daemonset/operator logging.
  * Also interested in Windows and macOS ecosystem.
